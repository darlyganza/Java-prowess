package Oop;
//this program demonstrates how a class is actually a blue print where we will define objects that have a copy of the properties, values and methods in the parent class:

public class Car {
	//merely creation of the class car doesn't mean that the objects are as well initiated and thus: 
	
	int numTyres, windows;
	String brandName, color;
	//the class car will have the above properties and the objects from this class will at all costs have this properties and some of the methods;
}
